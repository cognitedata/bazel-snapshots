# Using binaries

This examples show how you can use the Snapshot tool by building it from source code. This is a little more involved
than using the prebuilt binaries as more dpendencies are required for the building. Builing from sources depends on 
```gazelle```, ```protobuf``` and ```rules_go```. ```snapshots_deps()``` and ```snapshots_repos()``` is used for setting up the depencies 
for building from sources and using the Snapshot tool.
